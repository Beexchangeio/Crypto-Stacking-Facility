Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface to input the required parameters.
Displays the total amount after the stacking period.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-stacking-facility.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd crypto-stacking-facility
Run the script:
python stack_crypto.py
Follow the prompts and enter the required parameters:

Principal amount: The amount of cryptocurrency you want to stack.
Interest rate: The interest rate offered for stacking, expressed as a percentage.
Stacking duration: The duration, in years, for which you plan to stack the cryptocurrency.
The script will calculate the total amount after the stacking period and display it on the command-line interface.

Example
